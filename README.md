# Grey-level-Image-Quantization
This repository contains a Python implementation for grey level image quantization. The code reduces the number of grey levels in an image, allowing for efficient compression and analysis. 
Here's a suggested description for your GitHub repository:


## Features
- **Uniform Quantization**: Evenly distributes grey levels across the entire image range.
- **Non-Uniform Quantization**: Distributes grey levels based on the image histogram for better visual quality.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Set the number of grey levels and choose between quantization methods.
- **Examples and Visualizations**: Includes sample images and visualizations to illustrate the impact of different quantization techniques.
