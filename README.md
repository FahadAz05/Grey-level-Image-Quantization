# Grey Level Image Quantization

This repository contains a Python implementation for grey level image quantization. The code reduces the number of grey levels in an image, allowing for efficient compression and analysis. The implementation includes various methods for quantization, such as uniform quantization and non-uniform quantization, as well as examples demonstrating the effects of different quantization levels on image quality.

## Features
- **Uniform Quantization**: Evenly distributes grey levels across the entire image range.
- **Non-Uniform Quantization**: Distributes grey levels based on the image histogram for better visual quality.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Set the number of grey levels and choose between quantization methods.
- **Examples and Visualizations**: Includes sample images and visualizations to illustrate the impact of different quantization techniques.
